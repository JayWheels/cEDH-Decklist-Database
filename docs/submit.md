## What should be in the description?
The description should be a very short intro to the strategy and playstyle of the deck. Discuss topics such as the basic strategy of the deck, the metas and matchups it is well suited for, how the commander supplements the strategy, and the relevant key cards. You should be writing a really simple guide which helps players decide to whether or not to learn more about a deck. Descriptions should be at least a few sentences, but try to avoid making any essays.

## What is a primer?
A primer is a nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt. Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem. Ut enim ad minima veniam, quis nostrum exercitationem ullam corporis suscipit laboriosam, nisi ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur?
