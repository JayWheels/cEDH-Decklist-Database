# Markdown Test  
## Subheading
This is a test to see how markdown functions with Jekyll and this site. You can see this by reading the example text, which contains [links](test.com), as well as *creative* **formatting**.

## Rendering
This should render directly onto the About the DDB page of the new website. oo this update perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo.

Quis autem vel eum iure reprehenderit qui in ea voluptate velit esse quam nihil molestiae consequatur, vel illum qui dolorem eum fugiat quo voluptas nulla pariatur? 

## Table Categories
- Competitive
  - Decks that are intended for competitive and follow the minimum power guidelines in "About the DDB".
  - No joke decks, decks must be intended for competitive play.
  - Recommendations are given out based on our discretion. You can read about our criteria by which we recommend a deck in the "About the DDB" page.
- Deprecated
  - Old, banned, abandoned, outdated, or otherwise formerly-played decks.
  - Intended for archival purposes, so that players can find inspiration from lists that are no longer competitive.
  - No joke decks, decks must have been intended for competitive play at some point in the past.
- Meme
  - Joke decks, gimmicky decks, parodies, or otherwise comedic lists.
  - Submissions should be relatively known to the online cEDH community - don't just submit a random list directly to the meme table.
  - You must have created the deck and/or received permission from the deck's creator(s) before submitting it to the meme table. We'd like to avoid bullying our players.
