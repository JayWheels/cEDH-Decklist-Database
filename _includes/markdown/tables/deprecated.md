The 'Archived' category consists of two types of decks:
- Decks we feel no longer fit on the main page. This can be either because of general power level concerns, essential pieces being banned, or a lack of updates.
- Decks that were never on the main page, but were submitted directly into this category to display something that historically saw play.

Many of these lists could still work in a cEDH pod. They might just be a bit weaker compared to other options, or simply need a caring owner to take the deck to the next level once more.

If you see a deck in "Competitive" which you believe should be "Archived", please report it in [Make a Request](/request).
