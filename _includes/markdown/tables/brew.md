With the release of so many products, EDH is increasing in popularity and a lot of people want to play with new commanders. While we'd like to see these new commanders represented, many lists aren't maintained after the initial hype period. 

The Brewer's Corner is a solution for many of these concerns. New entries that do not fit under any of the existing ones will go into the Brewer's Corner. In terms of deck evaluations, we will be mostly concerned with optimizing the commander, rather than comparing them to existing entries. We will still have general power level guidelines (for example, it will probably be hard to admit Isamaru despite how optimized a list might be), but likely a lower bar than previous updates.

Each review cycle, the managers and the reviewers will revisit the entries in the Brewer's Corner.  We'll look into how well the decks are maintained and perform, and how frequently they're played after the initial hype.
