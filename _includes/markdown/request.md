# Make a Request
## This is for requests, not decks
If you would like to submit a new deck (a brand new entry on the database), then please use our other form, on the [Submit a Deck](/submit) page of the cEDH Decklist Database.  
  
## How to Hear Back from us
If you would like to receive a response from us about a request you've made, leave your Discord username with your response. We will tell you about the status of your request if you message a Database Manager on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/BXPyu2P).  
  
Otherwise, we will handle requests discretely. If we are suspicious that a request has not been made with the proper authority, we may contact deck curators or the Discord username supplied with the request.
