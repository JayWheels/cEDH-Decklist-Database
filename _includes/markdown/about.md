# About the DDB
## Recommendations
Deck recommendations are chosen to help players discover reliable options for strategies, color combinations, and archetypes that they are interested in.  
  
Contributing factors to a list being recommended:  
- Power level
- Overall popularity
- Color combination coverage
- Strategy coverage
- Archetype maturity

## Table Categories
### Competitive
- Decks that are intended for competitive and follow the minimum power guidelines (coming soon, probably).
- No joke decks, decks must be intended for competitive play.
- Recommendations are given out based on our discretion. You can read about our criteria by which we recommend a deck in the "About the DDB" page.  
  
### Deprecated
- Old, banned, abandoned, outdated, or otherwise formerly-played decks.
- Intended for archival purposes, so that players can find inspiration from lists that are no longer competitive.
- No joke decks, decks must have been intended for competitive play at some point in the past.  
  
### Meme
- Joke decks, gimmicky decks, parodies, or otherwise comedic lists.
- Submissions should be relatively known to the online cEDH community - don't just submit a random list directly to the meme table.
- You must have created the deck and/or received permission from the deck's creator(s) before submitting it to the meme table. We'd like to avoid bullying our players.
