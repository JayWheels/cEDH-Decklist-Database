# About the DDB

Welcome to the cEDH Decklist Database (DDB). The DDB is a showcase of different decks from cEDH.  **The goal of the DDB is to highlight the variety of different decks that exist within that space to help new players acclimate to cEDH concepts and possibilities while also helping established players find inspiration for brewing and playing**.  *The DDB is not a tier list*, nor a collection of tournament decks, and should not be considered in any way a list of the “best” decks in cEDH nor an exhaustive list of decks in cEDH. **It is a collection of decks that the DDB Managers and Reviewers believe underscore just some of a variety of options available to players within the world of cEDH.**


The decks shown on the DDB are looked over by an experienced team of reviewers before getting a final approval to be on the DDB by the manager team.  The following is a list of some of the different items that are taken into account when reviewing:


-A strategy that can hold its own in a cEDH environment

-Inclusion of all relevant cards for the deck’s strategy

-A chosen commander that enhances the deck’s performance

-The ability to relevantly impact the game state in the earliest turns of a game

-Listed on an approved decklist site



Notably, the DDB does not attempt to use gameplay data as a major arbiter of deck evaluation due to the difficult and nebulous nature of acquiring accurate gameplay data for cEDH. Although some team members may be involved in other projects addressing data within cEDH, those projects are not considered when making decisions regarding the DDB.


A submitted deck not being accepted to the DDB does not mean that deck is not mean the deck is not competitive, not fun, or not worth playing. It simply means the team did not want to display it at that time. As cEDH shifts, new cards are printed, and opinions change, resubmitted decks often find their way onto the DDB, so a deck not being on the DDB in a given review cycle is not the final word from the DDB team. 


## Brewer’s Corner vs. Main Page


**With the goal of highlighting different decks within cEDH, the DDB has a Brewer’s Corner page for new decks. The Brewer’s Corner is designed to showcase decks that have the potential to be on the main DDB page, but that the community may not be familiar with.**  The reviews for decks going to the Brewer’s Corner are less strict than decks going to the main page in order to allow time for those decks to be considered by a wider audience. With this goal in mind, reviews for consideration to the Brewer's Corner are less strict than when lists are considered for the main DDB page.


New deck archetypes accepted to the DDB will start on the Brewer’s Corner, and the decks on the Brewer’s Corner are all evaluated to potentially move to the main page or be removed during each review cycle.  If a decklist is maintained, and the strategy has proven itself to be strong enough to the DDB team, decks will move from the Brewer’s Corner to the main page. Brewer’s Corner reviews take into account the review and manager teams, as well as public feedback. Players can submit feedback on Brewer’s Corner decks through the feedback form available in the changelog channel on the DDB Discord as well as on the Brewer’s Corner section of the website. 


## Outdated and removed decks


The Outdated section is meant to display decks that have historically been played in cEDH but currently do not see a large amount of play either due to meta shifts or bannings, thus serving as a form of archive. It can also contain decks that are still viable, but where the creator of the list simply didn’t update it any more.


Decks can be submitted directly into the outdated section if it is a list that commonly saw play. Otherwise, any deck that is removed from the ‘Competitive decks’ section is automatically moved to ‘Outdated’. *Decks that have not been updated in six months will be moved to the outdated section regardless.* We use 'Last updated' fields on decklist sites to determine this duration. Decks that are deleted from the Brewer’s Corner are not put in the outdated section, as many of these decks are still being explored and likely didn’t fit our requirements.


## The DDB Team

As mentioned above, the DDB is maintained by a team of managers and reviewers.  The review team provides initial feedback on all the lists submitted to the DDB, in addition to providing ongoing feedback about the main DDB page, Brewer’s Corner lists, and the website itself. The review team currently consists of the following members:


-Alchmyst

-Avaloon

-Blazingscout

-deak

-DJYavimaya

-Eisenherz

-Forge10

-iraruel

-DefinitelyNotKevin

-Mormonator

-Raps

-Sinivi

-smartaleck

-Spleenface

-Ulavala



The management team oversees the review team’s work and uses their feedback to make final decisions regarding the DDB, in addition to handling the non-technical work on the DDB and discord. The current management team consists of:


-Cinestra

-Natux

-Sickrobot

-Squirrelmob


Additionally, the DDB would not function without the technical work of our volunteer web director, Average Dragon.
