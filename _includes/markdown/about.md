# About the DDB
Welcome to the cEDH Decklist Database (DDB). This resource is used to showcase viable and unique decks in competitive EDH. It is not meant as a comprehensive resource of all possibilities or the current metagame. More importantly, the database should not be considered a tier list. The main goal of the database is as a resource for knowing what possible decks you could play, or play against. Notably, different local metagames may feature some or none of these decks, and there may be many decks in local metagames that do not appear on the database but are still appropriately tuned to those games of cEDH.

## Submitting and deck requirements
Decks can be submitted through the form on the ‘Submit’ page. A submitted competitive deck is expected to follow these requirements:

- A strategy that has an expected winrate of around 25% in a competitive environment.
- Inclusion of all relevant staple cards for the strategy.
- No inclusions that don’t enhance the deck’s gameplan in some way.
- A commander that isn’t easily replaced by a stronger alternative.
- The ability to consistently interact with your opponents, or win the game, around turn three.
- The list is not hosted on TappedOut.
- Preferably, but this is not a hard rule, no overreliance on the commander.
 
Note that when a deck doesn’t follow these requirements, it may still be a good and fun deck in your personal meta. If your deck is not accepted to the database, it does not mean that the deck is not worth playing in any way. It is just not something we are interested in displaying to keep the quality of the resource high for people wanting to get into, or learn more about, the format.

The cEDH Decklist Database does not attempt to use gameplay data as a major arbiter of deck evaluation due to the difficult and nebulous nature of acquiring accurate gameplay data for cEDH.  Although some managers may be involved in other projects addressing data within cEDH, those projects are not considered when making decisions regarding the DDB.

## Brewer’s Corner vs. Main Page
If a deck is accepted, it will automatically be accepted into the Brewer’s Corner. For decks where the commander is new, or has gotten new tools in recent releases, we will be less strict with our requirements, as the goal of the Brewer’s Corner is to get people familiar with and excited about new decks. Since older decks and strategies do not follow this need, these are required to have ‘proven themselves’ to increase their chances of being accepted.

Players can submit feedback for decks on the Brewer’s Corner through a feedback form in the changelog channel of our Discord server.

If a decklist is maintained, and the strategy has proven itself to be strong enough, decks will move from the Brewer’s Corner to the main page. New lists for an already existing category are often added directly to the main page.

## Outdated and removed decks
The Outdated section is meant to display decks that have historically been played in cEDH but currently do not see play any more, thus serving as a form of archive. It can also contain decks that are still viable, but where the creator of the list simply didn’t update it any more.

Decks can be submitted directly into the outdated section if it is a list that commonly saw play. Otherwise, any deck that is removed from the ‘Competitive decks’ section is automatically moved to ‘Outdated’ one. Decks that have not been updated in six months will be moved to the outdated section regardless. Decks that are deleted from the Brewer’s Corner are not put in the outdated section, as many of these decks are still being explored and likely didn’t fit our requirements.
