# About the DDB
## Motivation
The Competitive EDH Decklist Database is a repository of common, important, and otherwise noteworthy decks in the cEDH format. The Competitive EDH Decklist Database is not intended to be a comprehensive resource or a full picture of the competitive EDH metagame at any given point in time, and should be used as a reference point and contributing resource rather than a defining set of rules and decks, decks excluded from the Competitive EDH Decklist Database may still be considered to be “cEDH”.
The Competitive EDH Decklist Database is not a tier list or an indicator of deck strength within the competitive EDH meta at large, and there is no hard and fast rule that a deck will be more or less powerful than any others.

## Deck Submissions
A new addition to the database should contain:
- A powerful and unique strategy within the cEDH format
- A commander that uniquely enables the deck and is not easily replaced by a more powerful option
- No obvious exclusions of staple cards without adequate justification

A deck entry is not meant to encompass all possible lists for a given archetype, but rather portray a proven and reliable option for a decklist or a direction for an archetype as well as the notable variations that have been created by notable pilots.


## Table Categories
### Competitive
- Decks that are intended for competitive and follow the minimum power guidelines (coming soon, probably).
- No joke decks, decks must be intended for competitive play.
  
### Deprecated
- Old, banned, abandoned, outdated, or otherwise formerly-played decks.
- Intended for archival purposes, so that players can find inspiration from lists that are no longer competitive.
- No joke decks, decks must have been intended for competitive play at some point in the past.  
  
### Meme
- Joke decks, gimmicky decks, parodies, or otherwise comedic lists.
- Submissions should be relatively known to the online cEDH community - don't just submit a random list directly to the meme table.
- You must have created the deck and/or received permission from the deck's creator(s) before submitting it to the meme table. We'd like to avoid bullying our players.
