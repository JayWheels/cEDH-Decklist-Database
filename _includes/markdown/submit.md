# Submit a Deck
Submitted lists are expected to follow these guidelines:
- A strategy that has an expected winrate of around 25% in a competitive environment.
- Inclusion of all relevant staple cards for the strategy.
- No inclusions that don’t enhance the deck’s gameplan in some way.
- A commander that isn’t easily replaced by a stronger alternative.
- The ability to consistently interact with your opponents, or win the game, around turn three.
- The list is not hosted on TappedOut.
- Preferably, but this is not a hard rule, no overreliance on the commander.

If a list historically saw play, you can submit it directly to the Outdated section.
   
## When will my deck be reviewed?
Decks are reviewed on roughly a bimonthly basis. You can see the next Submissions Deadline and Estimated Update dates on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/BXPyu2P).
