### Outdated
- Old, banned, abandoned, outdated, or otherwise formerly-played decks.

## When will my deck be reviewed?
Decks are reviewed on a roughly monthly basis. You can see the next Submissions Deadline and Estimated Update date on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/BXPyu2P). 
  
## What decks are accepted?
An addition to the database should contain:
- A powerful and unique strategy within the cEDH format
- A commander that uniquely enables the deck and is not easily replaced by a more powerful option
- No obvious exclusions of staple cards without justification
