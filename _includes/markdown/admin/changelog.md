## Edit Changelog
This page gives controls to modify the changelog on "About the DDB". After creating or editing a changelog post, there is a 30 minute cooldown to reduce site load.

Changelogs are rendered using Markdown. If you are unfamiliar with Markdown, [Github has an excellent introductory guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
