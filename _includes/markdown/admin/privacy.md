## Privacy Policy 
### Information we collect
All of our personally identifiable information (PII), which may include deck links, descriptions, usernames, or any other user-input field, will be removed upon request. This form functions as our users' main avenue for removing information from the Database. We will also respond to requests made on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/BXPyu2P), or PMs directly to a Database Manager.  
  
We will never sell, rent, or lease your Discord usernames, IP addresses, or any other submitted information to 3rd parties. We may use Discord usernames or submitted information to contact users in order to confirm information or ask questions about the decks.

### Google Ads and Analytics

Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads and collect analytics information. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to visitors based on their visit to sites they visit on the Internet.  
  
Website visitors may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy. Ad blocking software, such as uBlock Origin, will also nullify all of our 3rd-party data collection, and can function as an easy opt-out option.

### DMCA Takedowns
If you would like to issue a DMCA takedown regarding your copyrighted content, the [Make a Request](/request) page of the cEDH Decklist Database serves as the official avenue for issuing takedowns. Include a link to a PDF in the body of your submission, and select the "Other" option in the dropdown, and your request will be reviewed by a DDB manager.
