# Database Console
Welcome to the **Database Console**! This page renders similarly to the database, but all changes  made here are hidden until "Publish All Changes" is pressed. Because publishing changes to the site is an expensive operation, it has a **cooldown of 1 hour**.

Each deck on this page has a "Status". Decks which are **PUBLISHED** will appear on the site the next time changes are published, user-submitted decks are **SUBMITTED**, and deleted decks are **DELETED**.

The color of a deck on the "Published Decks" page corresponds to changes made since the last publishing. Newly-added decks are **green**, modified published decks are **blue**, and to-be-removed decks are **red**. When changes are published, these colors will reset in order to indicate parity between the published database and the console.

To edit a deck entry or change its status, expand it and click on the wrench icon in the left column.
