# Database Console
Welcome to the **Database Console**! This page renders similarly to the database, but all changes  made here are hidden until changes are selected and published using the "Publish Selected Changes" button.

Each deck on this page has a "Status". Decks which are **PUBLISHED** will appear on the site the next time changes are published, user-submitted decks are **SUBMITTED**, and deleted decks are **DELETED**. **DELETED** decks are purged after 30 days.

The color of a deck on the "Published Decks" page corresponds to changes made since the last publishing. Newly-added decks are **green**, modified published decks are **blue**, and deleted decks are **red**. When changes are published, these colors will reset in order to indicate parity between the published database and the console.

To edit a deck entry or change its status, expand it and click on the wrench icon in the left column.
