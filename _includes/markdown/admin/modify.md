## Modify Site
This page gives edit access to the various text blobs across the site. In order to minimize the load on the website, there is a 30 minute cooldown between submissions made on the same file. The [Github page for the DDB](https://github.com/AverageDragon/cEDH-Decklist-Database) will keep track of all file changes made here.

With the exception of the Message of the Day (the blue bar displayed on the top of the website), all text will be rendered as simple markdown. If you are unfamiliar with markdown, [Github has an excellent introductory guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
