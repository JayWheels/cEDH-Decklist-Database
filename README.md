# cEDH Decklist Database
A collection of Magic: The Gathering (MTG) decks from the Competitive EDH Format.

The site is hosted at [cedh-decklist-database.com](https://cedh-decklist-database.com). It utilizes Firebase as a backend for the forms, while the main database is prerendered using Jekyll to improve performance, take advantage of browser caching, and reduce the load on the backend.

## Features
- Deck listings with Scryfall-imported commanders and user-submitted information
- Sorting, searching, and filtering support on the main database
- Static rendering using Jekyll and Liquid to knit data files into static content
- Forms for new deck submissions and edit requests utilizing ReCaptcha and Firebase
- Responsive web design that renders a mobile-friendly site on smaller screens
- Arc Dark-inspired color theme
